Skill endorsements are a great way to recognize your 1st-degree connections' skills. Getting people to endorse you can open doors and unlock opportunities that might not have happened otherwise. This is obviously appealing to those who come across your profile, looking to find a partner in a business project, working arrangement, and so on.

We are firm believer in the law of reciprocity, which means that people are inclined to do something nice for you if you do something nice for them. It can be applied to endorsements as well. Endorse the skills of others, and there’s a good chance a considerable percentage of them will return the favor.
