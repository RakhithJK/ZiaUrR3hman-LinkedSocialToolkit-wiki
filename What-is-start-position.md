Start position is the initial value where software start performing action over search results. Mostly search request consist of 10 results. If software starts with start position 0, it will perform action over 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th...10th result one by one, then it will increment start position by 10 to get next 10 search results. This process is repeated until all search results are processed. 

By default, software automatically sets start position and saves it. You can change this automatic behavior by following these steps
1. Click the “**Change script settings**” button from  **Linked Social Toolkit** left menu
2. Uncheck "**Adjust start position automatically**"
3. Click the “**Save**” button
