### Adding already contacted user to some campaign
If you have sent any messages to your connections using any other tool or script or extension etc. or even manually and you don’t want to send message again to your connection, then this feature is used.

Another use-case for using this feature is, if you have removed Tampermonkey extension or uninstalled your browser or installed new Operation System (Windows, Mac or Linux), then Script database also gets removed.  When you re-install the script and start sending messages to your connections, then script would send duplicate messages because Script doesn’t have data about old campaigns. So, use feature to avoid sending duplicate messages to your connections. You need to use the feature before sending messages.
Click ![addCUC](https://github.com/ZiaUrR3hman/LinkedSocialToolkit/raw/master/images/addCUC.png) icon then confirm the dialog and wait until script finishes the process.
