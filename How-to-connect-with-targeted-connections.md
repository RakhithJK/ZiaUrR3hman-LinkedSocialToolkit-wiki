# Connect with targeted connections
You can connect with your targeted connections using search and other filters like industries, companies, locations etc.
## Feature explanation
### Search
![Search](https://github.com/ZiaUrR3hman/LinkedSocialToolkit/raw/master/images/Search.png)

This search field is equivalent to default search bar. You can use the **Search** to look for people with similar interests, role models, and Influencers to broaden your professional network and expertise.
To search for a specific person, enter your keyword into the Search field.

**Notes**
* You can search using keywords such as company or job title. For example, you can search for “**Richard Branson Founder**".
* If you don’t know the full name of the person you’re searching for, enter other information that you know about them. For example, you can search for “**Editor The Kansas City Star**”.
* You can also search for multiple people by typing your search criteria into the search bar.
Keep search field blank, if you don’t want to search by keyword or search term.

### Using Boolean search
You can run a Boolean search on by combining keywords with operators like AND, NOT, and OR during your search.
Here are some ways to use Boolean logic and construct your searches:
* **Quoted searches**: For an exact phrase, enclose the phrase in quotation marks. For example, type "product manager". You can also use quotation marks if you want to find someone with a multi-word title.
	* Search only supports standard, straight quotation marks ("). Other software or websites may use special symbols that our system does not recognize. Curly quotation marks (“), also known as smart quotes or typographer's quotes, aren't supported.
	* In order to optimize overall site performance, stop words such as "by", "in", "with", etc. aren't used.

* **NOT searches**: Type the word NOT (capital letters) immediately before a search term to exclude it from your search results. This typically limits your search results. For example, "programmer NOT manager".

* **OR searches**: Type the word OR (capital letters) to see results that include one or more items in a list. This typically broadens your search results. For example, "sales OR marketing OR advertising”.

* **AND searches**: Type the word AND (capital letters) to see results that include all items in a list. This typically limits your search results. For example, "accountant AND finance AND CPA".

* **Parenthetical searches**: To do a complex search, you can combine terms using parentheses. For example, to find people who have "VP" in their profiles, but exclude "assistant to VP" or SVPs, type **VP NOT (assistant OR SVP)** in search field.

![Boolean Search](https://github.com/ZiaUrR3hman/LinkedSocialToolkit/raw/master/images/Boolean-Search.png)

When handling searches, the overall order to precedence is:
1. Quotes [""]
2. Parentheses [()]
3. NOT
4. AND
5. OR

**Important**
* The + and - operators are not officially supported. Using AND in place of + and NOT in place of - makes a query much easier to read and guarantees that we'll handle the search correctly.
* When using NOT, AND, or OR operators, you must type them in uppercase letters.

### Using Search Operators
You can use search operators directly in search bar to narrow your results. Search operators complement the filters found on the right rail of the results page, as well as the Boolean operators AND, OR, and NOT.
There are five search operators currently supported:
* **firstname**- Finds members based on first name
* **lastname**- Finds members based on last name
* **title**- Finds members based on their current job title
* **company**- Finds members based on their current company (keyword search)
* **school**- Finds members based on schools attended (keyword search)
For example, to search for current software engineers not named Doe, who have attended either Harvard University or Stanford University, use following query in search field:

**title:"software engineer" NOT lastname:doe School(harvard OR stanford)**

### Tips for Using Search Operators
* Use quotes for multi-word search terms.
* Use parentheses for AND, OR and NOT phrases.
* Commas should not be included in between multiple search operators.
* Spaces should not be included in between the search operator and the search term, such as **lastname:doe**.
* Wildcard "*" searches not supported.
