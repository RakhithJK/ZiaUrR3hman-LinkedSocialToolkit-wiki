Social media has become the perfect place for social selling. It has the right mix of professional and personal that allows businesses to sell to potential clients in a way they will be most receptive to. That is why reaching out to people on social media is much more effective: response rate is an impressive 30-40%. Compare that with cold emailing, which has a 15% open rate and 2% response rate on average. Social selling is the future of sales.
